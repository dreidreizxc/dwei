                       Hi, I’ve been going back and forth on whether to say this, and I finally decided to take the risk. I like u!. There’s something about u that naturally stands out to me, and I didn’t want to keep pretending I didn’t feel that way.<br><br>

I want to be clear—I’m not expecting anything from this. No pressure, no awkward expectations. I just believe that honest feelings deserve to be said at least once.<br><br>

I really admire your positivity and the way u carry yourself. You seem genuine, kind, and easy to appreciate, even in small moments. There’s a calm confidence about y that makes people notice without u even trying.<br><br>

No matter how u feel about this, I’m completely okay with it. I just wanted u to know that someone sees u and genuinely appreciates who you are. Well, I’m glad I chose to take the risk over overthinking for once.<br><br>

That’s all, just something real I wanted to share. I hope this message brings a small smile to your day, at the very least. Also Thank u for ur time po haha <br><br>
