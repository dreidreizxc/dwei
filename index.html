                       Hi, I’ve been going back and forth on whether to say this, and I finally decided to just be honest. I like you. There’s something about you that naturally stands out to me, and I didn’t want to keep pretending I didn’t feel that way.<br><br>

I want to be clear—I’m not expecting anything from this. No pressure, no awkward expectations. I just believe that honest feelings deserve to be said at least once.<br><br>

I really admire your positivity and the way you carry yourself. You seem genuine, kind, and easy to appreciate, even in small moments. There’s a calm confidence about you that makes people notice without you even trying.<br><br>

No matter how you feel about this, I’m completely okay with it. I just wanted you to know that someone sees you and genuinely appreciates who you are. I’m glad I chose honesty over overthinking for once.<br><br>

That’s all—nothing demanded, just something real I wanted to share. I hope this message brings a small smile to your day, at the very least.<br><br>
                       
                    </p>
